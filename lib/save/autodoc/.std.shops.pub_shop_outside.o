You can also create food and serve it on plates, in boxes,or whatever.<p>The items on sale are either cloned from the armoury, cloned from a fileor cloned in the \"create_item()\" code in the pub code itself.  Containersfor these items are done in the same way, using the \"create_container()\"function.  This is the same as the \"create_object()\" system in\"item_shop.c\".  You can also buy items for other people (or groups ofother people) in the pub.<p>There are several standard glasses and plates available for drinks andfood in the \"pub_shop.h\" header file, if you don't want to create theglasses and plates yourself.  These plates use the \"/obj/misc/plate.c\"inheritable file.<p>A \"counter\" will automatically be placed in the pub.  If any item cannotbe moved into the person who ordered it (i.e they are carrying too much )it will be placed on the counter.  Empty glasses and so on will becleared from the counter after 3 seconds.  To ensure that this happens,make sure that the container object you use has the property \"pub item\"added to it.  Items will only be cleared if they are empty.",}),"started":({"23/10/1999",}),"author":({"Lemming",}),"see":({"/std/shops/inherit/pub.c","/include/shops/pub_shop.h","/include/volumes.hAdded help file as requested by Gin on August 2001",}),])
