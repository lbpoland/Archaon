There are two inheritables (this one and/std/vault.c) which are provided to make it easy to setup your ownvaults.This object should be inherited by your vault entrance area. It is used todefine most of the customisation for your vault.You must use set_vault_name and set_vault_entrance. You must also definea vault proprietor NPC and use set_proprietor() to let the system knowwhich NPC it is. You should also check for this proprietors location andexistance every reset. You may also want to provide some protection toprevent the NPC being killed too frequently.",}),"author":({"Ceres",}),"see":({"/std/vault_entrance.c",}),])
