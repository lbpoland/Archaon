Thistakes in an array of objects and or strings and returns a messagelike that shown above.

If all of the elements of\"args\" are objects, it simply returns the block control code forthe relevant shorts of the objects.  Otherwise, it looks throughthe elements one at a time, replacing objects by the result ofcalling the relevant short function on them; finally itconcatenates the elements with commas between each pair, exceptbetween the last pair which have \" and \" between them.  Since theoutput will contain processing codes if there are any objects in\"args\", it should be passed through convert_message before beingstored.<p>If you pass in a 1 for the 'quiet' flag, it will not take any of theobjects out of hiding.",}),"param":({"args the array to do the processing on","type the type of short to use \"a\", \"the\", \"one\", \"poss\"","no_dollars this forces the output to be a real string","quiet do not bring the objects out of hiding","dark how dark it is, used to hide object lists in the dark",}),"return":({"the processed string",}),]),}),])
