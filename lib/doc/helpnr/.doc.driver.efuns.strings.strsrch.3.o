The last occurance of `substr' can be found by passing `-1' as the 3rd argument (which is optional).  If the second argument is an integer, that character is found (a la C's strchr()/strrchr().)  The empty string or null value cannot be searched for. ",8,"RETURN VALUE","The integer offset of the first (last) match is returned.  -1 is returnedif there was no match, or an error occurred (bad args, etc). ",8,"SEE ALSO","explode(3), sscanf(3), replace_string(3), regexp(3)",})
