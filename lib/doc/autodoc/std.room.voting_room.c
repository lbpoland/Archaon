.SH Description
.SP 5 5

Generalised voting room intended to be inherited into rooms in the mud that
will setup the parameters and settings for votes.


The room does not inherantly support player initiated votes, however it is a fairly simple matter to add this to your own room and have your room add votes when players initiate them.
