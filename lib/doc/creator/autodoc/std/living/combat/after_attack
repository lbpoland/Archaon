.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function is called after it's all over and done (just before the
costs are charged). It can be used to do any special outcomes that
we may decide on.
Note that if you override this function in a special be absolutely certain
you know what you're doing if you return R_ABORT or R_DONE. Use of either
of these two could cause really nasty side-effects.
