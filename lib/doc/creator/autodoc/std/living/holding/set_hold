Editors Note: I have changed set_hold so that it no longer 
automatically unholds objects. I am moving that functionality to the
hold command. If you want your objects to be in a specific limb,
you have to free it up yourself using set_unhold.
If you don't care which limbs, you just have to free up enough limbs
to hold it.
