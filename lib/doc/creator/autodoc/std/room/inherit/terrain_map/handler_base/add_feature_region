.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method is called to add a new 'feature' to a terrain map.
Features have no real existance, but add atmosphere to a whole area,
by being visible across a large number of locations.
You define location, size, item desc, and add an array of 'longs'
sorted by distance, plus the usual item descriptions. Any occurrences
of $D in the longs array will be replaced by the direction in which
the feature lies.
