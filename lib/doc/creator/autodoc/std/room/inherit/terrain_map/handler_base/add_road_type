.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method is used to add a standard road type to the terrain map,
mapped to an ASCII character as used in the ASCII room map.
A road is a terrain map room which can be seen from adjacent locations.
The handler uses 'room_desc' to add an entry to the room description,
describing where the road goes. 'description' is added to the
descriptions of adjacent locations, to enable the road to be seen.
In 'room_desc' and 'description', $D will be expanded to the relevant
directions.
