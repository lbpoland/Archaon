.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method is used to setup any unusual sorts of entrances to 
specific room types.  For example so that you have to actually swim
to get into a river rather than acidentally walking into it.  If
this does return a string a default exit is not setup for this direction
so just going 'east' doesn't drop you in the river.
