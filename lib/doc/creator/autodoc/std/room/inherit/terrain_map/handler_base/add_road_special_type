%^BOLD%^type%^RESET%^ - the ASCII type used on the map to denote the room
%^BOLD%^base_path%^RESET%^ - the full pathname of the source file for the room
%^BOLD%^size%^RESET%^ - the number of rooms in each clump to skip over

%^BOLD%^room_desc%^RESET%^ - the 'continuation' description, which added to the room description to show where the road leads
%^BOLD%^description%^RESET%^ - the 'adjacent' description, which is seen from adjacent locations.

.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method is used to add a standard road type to the terrain map,
mapped to an ASCII character as used in the ASCII room map.
A road is a terrain map room which can be seen from adjacent locations.
The handler uses 'room_desc' to add an entry to the room description,
describing where the road goes. 'description' is added to the
descriptions of adjacent locations, to enable the road to be seen.
In 'room_desc' and 'description', $D will be expanded to the relevant
directions.
A skipped
room is one in which every nth room in the terrain will be skipped
unless it has something interesting in it.
