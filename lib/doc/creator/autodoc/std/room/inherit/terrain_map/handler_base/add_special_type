.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method is used to add a standard skip room type to the terrain map.
Mapped to an ASCII character as used in the ASCII room map.  A skipped
room is one in which every nth room in the terrain will be skipped
unless it has something interesting in it.  The height is used to
do specific sorts of checks, like if a specific direction is passable or not.
