.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method is called to add a new 'feature' to a terrain map.
Features have no real existance, but add atmosphere to a whole area,
by being visible across a large number of locations.  This method is
different to the normal add_feature in that the system will try
and construct a sentance from the features instead of once sentance
per feature.
You define location, size, item desc, and add an array of 'longs'
sorted by distance, plus the usual item descriptions. Any occurrences
of $D in the longs array will be replaced by the direction in which
the feature lies.
