.SH Description
.SP 5 5

With this function here, creators will be able to point and laugh when
someone dies by drowning in a water room because they'll see the death
reason in an inform.  It will also show up in the death log.  It would be a
good idea to mask this function to return a reason more specific to the
place where the drowning may occur (such as "drowning in the Djel"), or at
least a humorous one (such as "failing to realise that scuba gear hasn't
been invented yet") so that creators will have something to laugh at.
