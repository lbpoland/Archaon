.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function sets whether or not this room has a solid surface or bottom in
it.  If it does, then items may appear as being on the bottom, and living
objects are more able to resist currents (as they have something to hold on
to).  The parameter of this function can be 1 to make this room have a
bottom, 0 to make it have no bottom, or -1 (the default) to make it decide
whether or not it has a bottom by checking to see if it has any exits in the
current down direction (as set by set_down_dir).
