This function sets the message that will be displayed when an object sinks
into this room.  The string "$down$" will be replaced by the current down
direction for this room (as set by set_down_dir), and the usual other
$-expansion for messages will occur, including the replacement of "$F" by
the direction from which they are arriving.  The default is "$N sink$s
$down$ from $F.".
