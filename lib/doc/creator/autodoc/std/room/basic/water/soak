.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function makes things wet.  Anything entering a water room has this
function called on it by event_enter, and will have the wetness effect added
to it if appropriate, as well as to any appropriate objects inside it if it
isn't waterproof.  Open containers will also be filled with water.  The
function checks to see that the object is indeed inside the room, unless the
optional extra argument is non-zero.
