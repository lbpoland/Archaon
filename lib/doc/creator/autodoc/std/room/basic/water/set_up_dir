.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function sets the direction that is considered to be up by this room.
This is used by several exit messages, and by the water effect to decide
which way a panicking player will flee to try to reach the surface.  For
this reason, it should be set to the name of an exit which leads towards a
surface room.  Also, buoyant objects will be inclined to move in this
direction.  The default, of course, is "up".
