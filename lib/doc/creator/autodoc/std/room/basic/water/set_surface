.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function sets whether or not this room has an interface with air or
surface in it.  If it does, then living objects may breathe here, and
turbidity does not effect visibility.  The parameter of this function can be
1 to make this room have a surface, 0 to make it have no surface, or -1 (the
default) to make it decide whether or not it has a surface by checking to
see if it has any exits in the current up direction (as set by set_up_dir).
