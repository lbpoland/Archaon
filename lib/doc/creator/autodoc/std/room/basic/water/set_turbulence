.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function sets the turbulence of the water as a non-negative integer
variable.  A random number up to the turbulence is added to the difficulty
of all skillchecks to leave the room via a water exit with swim_exit as the
exit function, except when the exiting object is not moving of its own
accord (such as when it is being swept along by a current).  The default
turbulence is 100.
