.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This is an exit function set for any exits in a water room.  It finds the
difficulty of swimming through the exit, on the basis of the current through
that exit, the buoyancy of the object and the extra difficulty that it has
in swimming.  The swimming/immersion effect calculates the latter two with
calc_buoyancy and swim_difficulty respectively.  The object is subjected to
a skillcheck in other.movement.swimming to see if it can move through the
exit.
There is a guildpoint cost equal to 1/20th of the difficulty of the
skillcheck.
