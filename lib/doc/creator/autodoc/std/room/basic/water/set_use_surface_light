.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function sets whether the room will use the light levels of the
surface to determine its own.  If the function is called with a non-zero
value, the the current light level in the room will be overridden by a new
value based on the light of the room found by query_above_room.  If the room
above is an outside room, with light levels that depend on the time of day,
then the light in this room will be updated every time it is queried.  A
water room will default to using this option, but it will be overridden by
any calls to adjust_light (including calls to set_light).  It is possible to
call set_water_light to avoid this, but it should not be necessary.  If a
series of rooms with vertical exits between them are all set to use surface
light, then the effect will be for the light of the room at the top of the
stack to filter down through the rest, appropriately attenuated by
turbidity.
