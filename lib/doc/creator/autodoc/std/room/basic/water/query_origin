.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function returns the opposite to the direction of a particular exit.
This information is normally only accessible within the room handler, but it
is cached here in the origins mapping by the add_exit in this file.  If no
value is found, "elsewhere" will be returned.  This value is used in exit
messages to correctly display where they are coming from.
