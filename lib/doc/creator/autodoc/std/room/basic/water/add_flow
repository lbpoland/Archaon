.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function adds a water current flowing through a particular exit, which
may sweep objects through it or make it harder for them to swim through.
The second argument is the rate of flow.  If this is positive, then water
will be flowing from this room into the next one.  If it is positive, then
water will be flowing from the next room into this one.  It is up to the
coder of the specific rooms to ensure that the currents in different rooms
match one another.
