.EI

.SH Parameters
.SI 5
%^BOLD%^label%^RESET%^ - (mixed) label of the situation to start 
 up.  If you pass an array such as ({ "frog1", "frog2" }) for the 
label then that set of situations are started one at
a time and the total duration is split evenly between them.
Label is usually an integer or a string or an array of
integers and/or strings.
If the string is a list of labels
separated by , then multiple situations
are started using those labels.
%^BOLD%^duration%^RESET%^ - (int) total time (seconds) the overall situation 
should last.  You can put an array of durations -- one for each
situation if the label lists more than one situation and then
the overall time is the sum of the numbers.
-1 means indefinite so having any situations after
something with -1 duration is pointless.
%^BOLD%^handle%^RESET%^ - is an internal thing that should only be called with 0
unless you really know what you are doing.
%^BOLD%^words%^RESET%^ - is a list of replacements for #n in the text OR
       a random number seed, it is
       passed to choose_words.
       eg. ({ "#1", "frog", "#2", "honey" }) or 22
