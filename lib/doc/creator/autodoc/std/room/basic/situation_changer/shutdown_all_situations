.SH Description
.SP 5 5

Shuts down all current and pending situations.  It also turns off the
automated situation manager so no more are added.  It does not
destruct this object so all the add_situations are still loaded
and may be recommenced with automate_situation or change_situation.  
dest_me is the appropriate call to permanently remove all situations.
