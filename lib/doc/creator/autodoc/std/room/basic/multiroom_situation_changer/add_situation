%^BOLD%^num%^RESET%^ - number labelling the situation
%^BOLD%^func%^RESET%^ - function to be called at start of situation 
            that might be used to load NPC's.  If it is
            a set of two function pointers ({ f1, f2 })
            the second function is called when the
            situation is ended.  The start function is 
            passed the num label of the room and a
            do_start_mess flag.  If the flag is one
            the situation is starting rather than
            being reloaded.  The end function is only
            passed the num label.
