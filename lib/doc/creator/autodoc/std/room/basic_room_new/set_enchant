Sets the current enchantment level of the room.  The enchanment
level controls things like what happens when you flip coins and
some special messages which give wizards some idea about magic
levels.
When called from the room itself, it sets a background level of 
enchantment that don't decay, when called from another object it
sets the current enchantment which then decays towards the background 
level.
