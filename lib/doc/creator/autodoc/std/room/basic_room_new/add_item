.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method adds an item description to a room.  This allows you to
set up objects which do not as such exist, but can be looked at for
instance.  There should be a lot of these in rooms.  The name of
the item can be multiple word, and the plural for it is
automagicaly added, unless the no_plural flag is set.  If the name
is an array all of the elements in the array respond to the
description.


If the desc is set to an array, you can use this for handling things like read messages and so on too. Every second element in the array is the description/text to be printed and the other element is the command upon which the text should be printed. The special command 'long' is used to set the long description. 

The special type 'position' is used to allow people to use that item to do positions on, like stand, sit, lie etc. 

This method also allows you to setup add_command patterns. If the name after the verb is just a string, then the string will be printed when that verb is used. If it is just a function pointer then the function will be evaluated and the return result printed. If it is an array, then the first element must be a function pointer and the second optional element is the pattern to use for that method. Multiple patterns and functions may be specified.
