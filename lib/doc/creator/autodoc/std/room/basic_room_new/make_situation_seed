.SH Description
.SP 5 5

Makes a seed value for the random part of when 
situations turn on and off.  The two ints should be
constant for a given room -- eg. the coordinates.
If this function is not called the seed is 
generated from the file_name of the object.
For this reason, rooms that are clones will produce
erratic results unless this function is called.
