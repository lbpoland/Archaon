.SH Description
.SP 5 5

Shuts down all current and pending situations.  It also turns off the
automated situation manager so no more are added.  It does not
destruct this object so all the add_situations are still loaded
and make be recommenced with automate_situation.  dest_me is
the appropriate call to permanently remove all situations.  The
call is passed to the situation changer object.  If none exists
then nothing happens.  The situation changer is created when
an add_situation call is performed.
