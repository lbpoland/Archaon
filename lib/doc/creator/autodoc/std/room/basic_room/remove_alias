.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method removes the exit aliases from the room.
Aliases are convenient extra forms that can be attached to certain
exits. In the above functions, the variable names is either a string
or an array of strings and is, respectively, the alias or aliases
for the direction passed in word. Since, sometimes, the same alias
could be used for more than one exit, remove_alias() requires both
alias(es) and direction in order to remove the correct alias(es).
