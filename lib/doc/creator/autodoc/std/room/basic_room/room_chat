.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method sets up the room chats.
Room chats are strings which are printed at (semi) random intervals
in rooms.  They are used to add atmosphere to a room. A chat will
be picked at random from the array of chats with a frequency
controlled by the times min and max. ie. one will be picked every n
seconds where is varies between min and max seconds. Please don't
make the values for min and max too small or the messages just
become annoying!


The argument to the room_chat method is an array of the format:
.EP
.SP 5 5
({ int min, int max, ({ string *chats }) }). In place of a chat string you may use "#function_name" where function_name is a function that exists on the room object. 

Repeated calls to this function overwrite the chats for the default chatter. 

If this function is used in combination with the day/night chats then this sets the default chat items for the chatter. The frequency of chats will be taken from the day/night chats, but the messages from here will be merged into the day/night chats.
