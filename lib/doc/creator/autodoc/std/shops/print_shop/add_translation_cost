.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method will add the cost to translate from one language to
another.  The default is translating to the common language and
this cost will be used in both directions.  ie: the cost of translating
from djelian to common is the same as translating from common to
djelian.  If translating between two languages that are not the
default language, say the default is common and we want to translate
from djelian to wombat, then the cost from djelian->common and then
common->wombat will be used.
