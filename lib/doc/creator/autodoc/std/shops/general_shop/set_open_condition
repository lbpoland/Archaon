.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This sets the conditons which the shop will be open during.  If this
is set to an integer the shop will always be in that state, so
if you set the open condition to 0, it would always be closed.
If it is set to a string, then that function will be called on
this object to test to see if it is open.  If it iset to 
function pointer, the function pointer will be evaluated.  If it
is set to an array, the first element specifies the object and the
second specifies the function to call.
