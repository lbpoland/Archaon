.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method is used to add an item to the storage.
When this method is called, create_object() is called
(with the object name as an arg) in the inheriting file.
If no object is returned by that function,
the name is cloned with clone_object(), and failing that
request_item() is called in the armoury against the name.

This method makes add_weapon() and add_armour() obsolete.
