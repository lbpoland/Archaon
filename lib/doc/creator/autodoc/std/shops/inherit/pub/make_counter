.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function creates the counter for the pub.  It defaults to cloning
PUB_COUNTER_FILE and making it a hidden object.
If you are creating your own counter object then making it hidden is a
good idea.  If it's not hidden, make sure it at least cannot be moved or
buried.
The counter should clear empty objects with the "pub item" property if
they are placed on it.  Making it clear non-empty objects is a bad idea,
since items will be placed here if the purchaser is unable to carry
them.
