.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function sets up the closing code for stores.  This allows you to 
 close and lock up the place, update external rooms, send the shopkeepers 
 home, and catch burglars who try to sneak in.
 

If the "night" flag is 1, the store will close at night. If it's 0, the store will close during the day. 

The shopkeeper name should be the string filename of the shopkeeper. This can be set to "none" for no shopkeeper (regular event_person_say stuff will be used to simulate it.) 

*outside is an array of exit, room path pairs that connect to the shop. That is, if you moved east to get into the shop, the exit string will be "east", "/path/of/room/we/got/here/from". THIS IS REQUIRED, so that players will be moved to the right place. 

The burglar_func parameter is the name of a function that will be called when someone enters the shop after it is closed. It will be called with the argument object ob, where ob is the person who entered. For no burglar handling, this argument can be 0.
