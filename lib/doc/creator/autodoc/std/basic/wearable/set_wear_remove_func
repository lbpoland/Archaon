.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method sets the current function associated with wearing and
removing the item.  The value of this function should be choosen
carefully, using an object reference for the name will work but
it will not then be able to restored from the save file.  The same
goes for using function pointers.  It is better to use a real
file name and a string function name.


The function will be called with two arguments, the first argument will be 0 if the object is being removed or the object which it is being worn by if it is non-zero. The second argument will always be the person who was wearing the item, or is about to wear the item.
