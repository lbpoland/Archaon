.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method fits a message into a the current players screen size.  This
does all sorts of other evil stuff too, like handling indenting and
all sorts of things!  Most of which I do not understand so I won't
say anything about here.  The $C$ does capitalization, $I$<num>= does indenting of all the following lines of <num> spaces. The message automatically has $I$0=$C$ prepended to the message if it does not start with $I$. SO if you start a message with $I$ then it will not capitalize the first letter of the message.
