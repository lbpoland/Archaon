.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function will get called when all other commands and actions
have refused to do anything for this input from the user.  This
function adds some extra time for the user, and then returns.



This function is registered via add_action() with a priority of -10000. If you want to bypass it, then use a priority higher than that. If you want to see what strings get dropped by the entire add_action() stack, then use a priority lower.
