.SH Description
.SP 5 5

Some of the soul commands force the target to do something.
An example is the 'tickle' soul, which forces the target to
'giggle'.  Those soul-forces call this function.  But only
the soul object can use this function: any other object which calls
this function will be ignored.  This prevents this function
from being used to bypass the security checking on the
'force' command.
