.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This is the method used to define the envelope.  It works just like the
"make_bottle()" call on "/obj/bottle.c", and must be done whenever one is
created.  The description should be short and should not include the size
of the envelope - this will be inferred from the size specified.  A size
of 3 or less will be "small", 4 to 5 will be "medium", 6 to 8 is "large"
and anything over that will be a "large packet".  The default and minimum
size is 2.
