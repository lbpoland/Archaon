.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method should never ever be used.  Use of this call is meant to be
broken.  Old code that uses check_playtester() probably meant to use
query_playtester().  Use this instead (or better, query_tester()).  If you
wish to hire a playtester using this call (which is what it actually did!),
please look at hire_playtester() and add_playtester().
