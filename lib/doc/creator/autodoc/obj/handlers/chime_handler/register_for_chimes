.SH Description
.SP 5 5

Register a clock to do chimes. The num parameter specifes when to
chime.  If it is 1 then the clock chimes every hour, if it is
2 the clock chimes ever half hour, if it is 4 the
clock chimes every quarter hour.  Anything else and
the clock never chimes.  NB: if you set it to chime the quarter hours
it will only chime the quarter hours, it will not chime the hours
or the half hours.  You need to call this function three times to
get your clock to chime the hour, half and quarter hours.


The function "chime" will be called on the clock when the chime occurs. The message will be passed in as the first argument, the second will be the type of chime (CHIME_HOUR, CHIME_HALF_HOUR, CHIME_QUARTER_HOUR).
