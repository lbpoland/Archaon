.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function does almost exactly what register_refresh() does,
but it is used for registering delete handlers.

Delete callbacks are called with two parameters as well, but
the first parameter is a string containing the player's name,
while the second parameter is the integer PLAYER_DELETED.
