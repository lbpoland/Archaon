.SH Description
.SP 5 5

 This function will take an integer and turn it into a pretty string
 based on the various and sundry options you pass to it.  You pass the
 variable t to the function, which represents the number of seconds
 you want to turn into a string.  max_elements is the first option, and
 it specifies how many elements you would like to return.  It will
 default to two, and -1 will mean "any number of elements".

am_time is a boolean value which tells the function how to interpret the 't' variable. If you pass true (1) then it will interpret the seconds as game seconds, if you pass false (0), then it will interpret them as real-life seconds.

Finally, use_words will determine whether or not the function will use numbers (e.g., 2 years and 24 hours) or words (e.g., two years and twenty-four hours).

@param t how many seconds to turn into a string @param max_elements the maximum number of time elements to return @param am_time whether to interpret t as game time or real time @param use_words whether to return numbers or words @example query_time_string (86410) will return "1 day and 10 seconds" @example query_time_string (86461) will return "1 day and 1 minute" @example query_time_string (86461, -1) will return "1 day, 1 minute, and 1 second" @example query_time_string (86461, -1, 0, 1) will return "one day, one minute, and one second" @author Sousjagne
