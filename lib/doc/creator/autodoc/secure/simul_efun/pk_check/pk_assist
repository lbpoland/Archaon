.SP 5 5

This method checks to see if both of the objects are able to assist each
other. This will return 1 if they cannot complete the action and 0
They are not able to assist each other if one of them is not PK and
the other is and the PK is in combat with other players.


If an object is passed into this method, it is first checked with the method query_owner_pk_check(), if this returns a non-zero value it is used as the person who owns the object. This allows objects to be pk checked when they are not players.
