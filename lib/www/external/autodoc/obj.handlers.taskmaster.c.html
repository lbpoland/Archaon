</pre><dd>
This function will compare the skills of two objects and return which one
won and if the winner got a TM.
With equal skills the chances are 50/50 as to who will win. As the balance
shifts so do the chances. Additionally a modifier can be applied to
account for conditions favouring one or the other. This should be
considered a percentage eg. -50 will add 50% to the defenders chances of
winning.
If
<p>
<dd><dl>
<dt><b>Parameters:</b>
<dd>offob - The attacking object
<dd>offskill - The name of the skill the attacker is using
<dd>deffob - The defending object
<dd>deffskill - The name of the skill the defender is using
<dd>modifier - The percentage modifier
<dd>off_tm_type - This should be one of the standard definitions in
/include/tasks.h and is for the attacker
<dd>def_tm_type - This should be one of the standard definitions in
/include/tasks.h and is for the defender
<dd>degree - Enable the degree-of-success code.  If this is used, the
 return value becomes a class instead of an int.

<dt><a name="is_critical">
<img src="images/cyan-ball.gif" width=12 height=12 alt=" * "><b>is_critical</b></a><pre>
int is_critical(int margin)
</pre><dd>
Figure out whether a given margin of success/failure will result
in a critical or not.  Takes an integer between -100 and 100,
representing the margin by which a skillcheck succeeded, and does
some logarithmic-type equations to figure out whether it should
result in a critical or not.<p>
<dd><dl>
<dt><b>Parameters:</b>
<dd>margin - the margin of success.
<dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>1 if the result is a critical, 0 otherwise.

</dl>

varargs mixed perform_task(object person,
string skill,
int difficulty,
int tm_type,
int degree)
</pre><dd>
This function will perform a task.  It handles all the stuff about
looking up the skill, and giving the tm advance, but doesn't give
any messages to the player, you'll have to do that.
If you set the 'degree' parameter to 1, it will return a 3-element
class instead of the standard binary success/failure result.
<p>
<dd><dl>
<dt><b>Parameters:</b>
<dd>person - the one attempting the task (could be any living thing)
<dd>skill - the skill tested against
<dd>difficulty - the lowest bonus where the attempt can succeed
<dd>tm_type - This should use one of the standard definitions in 
/include/tasks.h. They are:
       TM_FIXED - for use where the difficulty is a fixed value
       TM_FREE  - for use when the tm attempt doesn't cost anything.
       TM_CONTINUOUS - for use in continuous actions eg. combat or sneak
       TM_COMMAND - for use with guild commands
       TM_RITUAL - when the action is a ritual
       TM_SPELL - when the action is a spell
       TM_NONE - when you want there to be no chance of a tm
<dd>degree - Whether or not to use the degree of success code

<dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>BARF if something screwed up, AWARD if the task succeeded, and
should give an advance, SUCCEED if it succeeded, FAIL if it failed. If
the degree of success code is used, it will pass out a 3-element class.
