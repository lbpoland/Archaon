This class controls the entire command queue for all player
objects.  Whenever a player tries to execute a command,
it gets placed in a queue here and eventually (during the
player's heart_beat()), the command will (hopefully) be executed.

<p>Since this class is a nexus of control for player commands, it
is also the natural place for a number of other utilities and
functions which also affect the execution of all commands.
Among these are things like drunk_check(), do_soul(), etc.

Sets the function to be executed if the command is interrupted.
It is also executed if teh command finished.  If it is interrupted
the first arguement to the called function will be the amount of time
it had left to complete.  If it complets successfuly, this
argument will be 0.  If the first argument is a function pointer,
this will be used instead.<p>

int soul_com_force(string str)
</pre><dd>
Some of the soul commands force the target to do something.
An example is the 'tickle' soul, which forces the target to
'giggle'.  Those soul-forces call this function.  But only
the soul object can use this function: any other object which calls
this function will be ignored.  This prevents this function
from being used to bypass the security checking on the
'force' command.
<p>
<dd><dl>
<dt><b>Parameters:</b>
<dd>str - the command being forced
<dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>0 if the command was ignored, otherwise 1.

<dt><a name="soul_commands">
<img src="images/cyan-ball.gif" width=12 height=12 alt=" * "><b>soul_commands</b></a><pre>
void soul_commands()
</pre><dd>
This is a setup function that is called by the player object.
It is used to register the lower_check() and drunk_check()
functions.  Plus it initializes the alias object, the
nickname object, and the history object.
<p>

</dl>
<hr><h2>Protected Functions</h2>
These are functions that only objects inheriting the class can access.<p>
<dt><a name="drunk_check">
<img src="images/magenta-ball.gif" width=12 height=12 alt=" * "><b>drunk_check</b></a><pre>
int drunk_check(string str)
</pre><dd>
This poorly named function was originally used to affect the
player's behavior when they are drunk, and to prevent any
player from doing anything in the event that they are passed
out.  Now the function also is responsible for adding commands
to the player's command queue, for implementing the 'stop'
and 'restart' commands, and for ensuring that the player can quit
the game, even when queueing.

<p>To see if a player is passed out, it checks the
"passed out" property.  If that property is nonzero, then
the player will be prevented from doing the command unless
that player is also a creator.  By default, it will print
a message that says: "You are unconscious.  You can't do
anything.\n".  If the function query_passed_out_message() is
defined on the player object (usually by a shadow), and
returns a string, then that string is printed instead.

<p>This function is registered with
add_action("drunk_check", "*", 10000),
so it can be avoided by registering a higher priority add_action.
But that is not necessary, because if bypass_queue() has
been called, this function will do nothing.  Please note that
you should not be using add_action.
<p>
<dd><dl>
<dt><b>Parameters:</b>
<dd>str - the command being executed

<dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd>0 if nothing was done, 1 if drunk_check() blocked
the command.

void flush_queue()

This method flushes all the queued commands.  It increments the time by the
ROUND_TIME define and checks to see if any of the commands now need to be
executed.  This should be called each heart beat..

This is the command called by the driver on a player object every
time a command is executed.  It expands the history comands.
