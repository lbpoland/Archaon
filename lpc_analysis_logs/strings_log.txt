interview_inherit.c | 77 | "First of all, I'd like to congratulate you for getting this far with the "
interview_inherit.c | 78 | "application process.  The second part of the application, in addition to "
interview_inherit.c | 79 | "testing descriptive and coding skills, is also designed to help weed out "
interview_inherit.c | 80 | "those who aren't really serious about becoming creators.  :-)"
interview_inherit.c | 81 | "I should make it clear at this point that getting this far doesn't mean "
interview_inherit.c | 82 | "that you're guaranteed a promotion.  We just want to get a fuller "
interview_inherit.c | 83 | "appreciation of applicants before we reach a decision on whether you are "
interview_inherit.c | 84 | "to be promoted or not.  :-)"
interview_inherit.c | 85 | "Being a creator, regardless of the rumours or jokes to the contrary, is "
interview_inherit.c | 86 | "not an easy option.  Unlike many MUDs, being a creator on "
interview_inherit.c | 86 | " is "
interview_inherit.c | 87 | "not the same as early retirement.  You'll be expected to spend time "
interview_inherit.c | 88 | "coming to terms with the mudlib (the body of code that is used to "
interview_inherit.c | 89 | "create the MUD) and your domain (the areas you actually adventure "
interview_inherit.c | 90 | "in).  As a creator, you have considerable power over large segments of "
interview_inherit.c | 91 | "the MUD.  The important thing is learning how to use that power "
interview_inherit.c | 92 | "responsibly."
interview_inherit.c | 93 | "We have a number of strict rules on "
interview_inherit.c | 93 | " .. rules you should be "
interview_inherit.c | 94 | "aware of before you make any decisions as to whether the role is for "
interview_inherit.c | 95 | "you.  Creators aren't allowed to affect the game in any measurable "
interview_inherit.c | 96 | "way.  Chatting is fine... killing NPCs at random or indiscriminately "
interview_inherit.c | 97 | "cloning cash for players is not."
interview_inherit.c | 98 | "Being a creator is also not about policing the "
interview_inherit.c | 98 | "   That falls "
interview_inherit.c | 99 | "under the jurisdiction of Admin and the Liaison domain.  As a coding "
interview_inherit.c | 100 | "creator your responsibilities lie in dealing with the code that "
interview_inherit.c | 101 | "makes up the MUD.  It is quite common that you will be approached by "
interview_inherit.c | 102 | "players with questions, particularly when they are no liaisons "
interview_inherit.c | 103 | "online.  In cases such as this, you are expected to refer them to "
interview_inherit.c | 104 | "a liaison or a Director.  If none are online, you are expected to ask "
interview_inherit.c | 105 | "them to wait until one is."
interview_inherit.c | 106 | "In rare cases, it will be necessary for immediate action to be "
interview_inherit.c | 107 | "taken... in such cases, it may be acceptable for you to deal with a "
interview_inherit.c | 108 | "player problem yourself.  Always keep in mind however that you are "
interview_inherit.c | 109 | "here to code.  If it is liaising and player interaction that you think "
interview_inherit.c | 110 | "you would enjoy most, it would be best to consider an application "
interview_inherit.c | 111 | "instead to the Liaison domain."
interview_inherit.c | 112 | "There is also a stern security policy on "
interview_inherit.c | 112 | "   As a creator, you "
interview_inherit.c | 113 | "are expected not to violate this policy.  This means:  No passing "
interview_inherit.c | 114 | "creator information on to players, and no revealing what is posted on "
interview_inherit.c | 115 | "creator boards.   As a creator you have access to a lot of information "
interview_inherit.c | 116 | "players do not... this information should be treated as confidential "
interview_inherit.c | 117 | "unless you have Express Permission from your Leader that you may reveal "
interview_inherit.c | 118 | "it.  In short, we have to be able to trust you with sensitive "
interview_inherit.c | 119 | "information."
interview_inherit.c | 120 | "The most important thing to remember is that you are expected to "
interview_inherit.c | 121 | "create.  If all you're really interested in is coding toys, then this "
interview_inherit.c | 122 | "role is not for you.  "
interview_inherit.c | 122 | " is not strict in the sense of 'You have "
interview_inherit.c | 123 | "to code X rooms per day!', but you are expected to make a measurable "
interview_inherit.c | 124 | "and consistent contribution to your domain.  Your Leader and the "
interview_inherit.c | 125 | "deputy immediately supervising you will check up on this on a "
interview_inherit.c | 126 | "regular basis."
interview_inherit.c | 127 | "It may sound like an awful lot of work to be a creator... and it is.  "
interview_inherit.c | 128 | "But at the same time, it's an awful lot of fun, and provides you with "
interview_inherit.c | 129 | "the means of giving something back to a MUD that has hopefully provided "
interview_inherit.c | 130 | "you with many hours of entertainment.  :-)"
interview_inherit.c | 131 | "Now that the movie is over, are you still willing to continue your "
interview_inherit.c | 132 | "application to be a creator?  If not, then the exit 'drum' will "

terrain_teacher.c | 86 | "'In this terrain, we have the doorstep (a fixed room) and all the "
terrain_teacher.c | 87 | "rooms of the field (floating).  The primary difference between "
terrain_teacher.c | 88 | "floating and fixed rooms is that you can only have one of each "
terrain_teacher.c | 89 | "fixed room in a terrain, but you can have any number of floating "
terrain_teacher.c | 90 | "rooms."

terrain_teacher.c | 94 | "'When I created this terrain, I just said that the field should "

terrain_teacher.c | 96 | "and it automatically took the place of the field room that would "
terrain_teacher.c | 97 | "have been here."
terrain_teacher.c | 98 | "'This is an important concept: floating rooms cover predefined "
terrain_teacher.c | 99 | "regions, while fixed rooms are in one place.  When a particular "
terrain_teacher.c | 100 | "location is in the region of a floating room _and_ is the location "
terrain_teacher.c | 101 | "of a fixed room, the fixed room wins."
terrain_teacher.c | 102 | "'This makes it so you can define huge sweeping areas of the floating "
terrain_teacher.c | 103 | "rooms, and just plop down your fixed rooms in strategic areas."
terrain_teacher.c | 105 | "'Now, when I say 'location', what I'm referring to is the coordinates "

terrain_teacher.c | 110 | "'Walk around a bit, and see how the coordinates change as you move "
terrain_teacher.c | 111 | "in the different directions.  You will see the first number "
terrain_teacher.c | 112 | "increase when you walk north, and decrease when you walk south.  "
terrain_teacher.c | 113 | "The second increases when you walk east, and the third increases "
terrain_teacher.c | 114 | "whenever you go up."

terrain_teacher.c | 138 | "'When it lists the floating room, it tells you the name of the "

terrain_teacher.c | 140 | "one final number.  That last number is a priority.  We'll talk "
terrain_teacher.c | 141 | "about that in the second lesson.  For now, ignore it."
terrain_teacher.c | 142 | "'In this terrain, we have the field room in the whole area where "
terrain_teacher.c | 143 | "the first coordinate is between -100 and 100 (inclusive), the "
terrain_teacher.c | 144 | "second coordinate is between -100 and 100 (inclusive), and "
terrain_teacher.c | 145 | "the third coordinate is equal to 800000."
terrain_teacher.c | 146 | "'The only reason for that strange third coordinate was that I wanted "
terrain_teacher.c | 147 | "to keep these rooms far away from the player areas."
terrain_teacher.c | 148 | "shrug"
terrain_teacher.c | 149 | "'That number before the file name is just an index in the list of "
terrain_teacher.c | 150 | "floating rooms.  Since we only have one floating room, it isn't "
terrain_teacher.c | 151 | "very useful to us."
terrain_teacher.c | 153 | "'Both of our rooms inherit /std/room/outside.  That makes the rooms 100 "
terrain_teacher.c | 154 | "units wide in each direction.  So in that range of coordinates, we "
terrain_teacher.c | 155 | "can have 3 rooms: -100, 0, and 100 for each of the first two "
terrain_teacher.c | 156 | "coordinates.  So the whole terrain is a 3x3 block."
terrain_teacher.c | 158 | "'Now looking at the fixed room, it gives you the name of the file "
terrain_teacher.c | 159 | "and _one_ set of coordinates.  That's it.  There's only the one set "
terrain_teacher.c | 160 | "of coordinates, because each fixed room can only be in one location."
terrain_teacher.c | 161 | "'If you try to add another fixed room with the same file, the "
terrain_teacher.c | 162 | "terrain control room will gripe at you and refuse to do it.  You'll "
terrain_teacher.c | 163 | "have to remove the old room first.  You do that with the \"

terrain_teacher.c | 164 | "command, but we'll get to that later."
terrain_teacher.c | 166 | "'Notice that the fixed room is at (-100, 0, 800000).  That is inside "

terrain_teacher.c | 168 | "the first and second coordinates are between -100 and 100, and the "

terrain_teacher.c | 334 | "you can tell by all the weather we're having.  However, it's not "
terrain_teacher.c | 335 | "the usual size."
terrain_teacher.c | 336 | "lsay Do 'find -d setup() here', to read the setup function for this "
terrain_teacher.c | 337 | "room.  Notice how I have a call to set_room_size() just before "
terrain_teacher.c | 338 | "the call to set_terrain().  That set_room_size() controls how far "
terrain_teacher.c | 339 | "the walls are from the center of the room.  So this room is twice "
terrain_teacher.c | 340 | "that width: 40 units across and 40 units tall."

terrain_teacher.c | 343 | "to this room."
terrain_teacher.c | 345 | "lsay You can change the size of any room you want this way, but "
terrain_teacher.c | 346 | "make absolutely sure that you call set_room_size() _before_ "
terrain_teacher.c | 347 | "you call set_terrain().  That is critically important, and all "

terrain_teacher.c | 349 | "exits showing up, if you get that wrong."
terrain_teacher.c | 350 | "lsay Also, set_room_size() can take an array of 3 coordinates to "
terrain_teacher.c | 351 | "control the size of the room separately in all three dimensions."
terrain_teacher.c | 352 | "lsay Unfortunately, the terrain handler doesn't understand that "

terrain_teacher.c | 370 | "'Here I've done something different.  The mountainsnows room "
terrain_teacher.c | 371 | "makes a big square, 5 by 5.  In the very center of that square, "

terrain_teacher.c | 373 | "lesson, that when the filename of a floating room is 'nothing', "
terrain_teacher.c | 374 | "the terrain handler puts no room at that location.  So here we "
terrain_teacher.c | 375 | "have the floating terrain with a hole in the middle."
terrain_teacher.c | 376 | "'Inside that hole, I plopped down the cabin.  How it's not "
terrain_teacher.c | 377 | "centered in that hole, it's actually to the west of the center."
